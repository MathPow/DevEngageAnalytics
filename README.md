 ## About The Project

![ScreenShot](https://github.com/MathPow/MathPow/blob/main/banner.png)

DevSocialsStats is an open-source project focused on tracking and analyzing social media statistics from platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Stack Overflow, and LinkedIn. It offers valuable insights into developer activity, engagement, trends, and sentiment analysis within the dynamic developer community. We employ a card and panel format to efficiently showcase user information within specific sections.

I've encountered challenges in swiftly conveying my expertise to others. I aim for potential recruiters to grasp my capabilities at a glance. Given that many recruiters quickly skim through CVs and portfolios, it's crucial to capture their attention promptly and highlight essential information.

To cater to varying preferences for information depth, the social media profiles will always be directly accessible from the cards themselves, which are interactive with hovercard functionality.
