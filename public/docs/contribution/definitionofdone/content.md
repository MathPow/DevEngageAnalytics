<h4 style="color: gray;">What criteria do we consider to mark an issue as done?</h4>

The Definition of Done outlines the criteria that must be met for an issue or task to be considered complete and ready for deployment. It serves as a shared understanding among team members regarding the quality and completeness of the work.

<h3 id="listofcriteria">List of Criteria</h3>

1. **Functional Requirements**: The issue meets all functional requirements as outlined in the user story or task description.

2. **Code Quality**: The code is well-written, follows coding standards, is adequately commented, and does not introduce any new bugs or regressions.

3. **Review**: The issue has undergone peer review, where other team members have reviewed the code changes, provided feedback, and approved the changes.

4. **Integration**: The issue has been integrated into the main codebase or deployment pipeline without causing conflicts or breaking existing functionality.

5. **Documentation**: Any necessary documentation has been updated or created. (Only if explicitly stated in the description of the issue)

6. **Testing**: The issue has been thoroughly tested, including unit tests, integration tests, and any required manual testing. Test coverage should be sufficient, and all tests should pass. (Only if said in the description of the issue)

_We do not mandate documentation or testing. In our open-source project, if someone can fulfill the task but is unable to handle the documentation or testing, we will create a separate issue dedicated to those tasks._
